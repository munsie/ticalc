All programs were written by Dennis Munsie unless otherwise mentioned.

BREAKOUT
--------

This program was originally written by an unknown person for the TI-85.  I ported it to the TI-82 in 1993 and added some new features as well.  There are 8 different level layouts.  You get a bonus paddle every 5000 points.

This program is used by the other programs to setup the display with a 1:1 mapping of the coordinates to the screen pixels.

FIGHTER
-------

This is a side fighter game that uses text mode.  Originally written by Scott McGregor back in 1994 for the TI-82, futher optimized by myself.  The controls are Up/Down to move your fighter, Y= to fire, Graph to pause/unpause and Clear to quit.

MINITTT

Tic-Tac-Toe game, originally written for the TI-82 around 1993/1994.  There is no AI, so both X and O have to be played by an actual player.

SLOTS
-----

Slot machine game, originally written for the TI-82 in 1994.  Graphics were done by Kevin Johnson.  This game is a full featured slot machine simulator.  The only keys used are the set of five keys directly under the screen.  There are on screen menus to guide the user.  There is also a hidden cheat mode.
